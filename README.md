The database in the database directory can be imported on phpmyadmin. If you have to add updates to the database, be sure to replace the file in this repository with the updated database file.

As of now, all tables and associated attributes have been added to the database file. Most data types are correct, however, some may need to be changed later for better database efficiency. The appropriate relations between tables have also been created as well as all keys for each table.
